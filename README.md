# NY-Citi-Bikeshare

## Purpose
Purpose was to use data from the NYC Citi Bike Program to see if it would be possible to recreate this in Des Moines, IA. Converted a CSV file into a Pandas dataframe to manipulate in Tableau for visualizations.

## Results

In visualizing this data, there were some trends that could be depicted easily with Tableau.

How long did people need these bikes for?

Answer: Almost always less than an hour, which means this could tell us that local travel or commuting was the motivation to rent/subscribe.

Let's take it one step further.

How would we define the most common user of this service?

Answer: In depicting the spread of data across genders, it appears that men are more likely to subscribe to this service and use bicycles for daily use. Potentially commuting to work, running errands, etc.

Again, how are these users really utilizing bicycles? Ideally we could define a common schedule for the standard 9-5 work day. Let's use one of the heat maps we created to define the time frames in which these bicycles were commonly used.

Answer: This is a common theme. Commuting men use this. Feels like I'm beating a dead horse since it wouldn't take this many visualizations to capture the point here......

Another question in this. Are these users subscribers or more of a single time user?

Answer: A hefty portion of the users are subscribers, which would carry the theme of commuter life. Typical users will use this M-F to commute to and from work because it saves them the hassle of driving in NYC, avoiding parking, saving the environment, etc.

Final question. Where are these people traveling? Though I am not familiar with NYC, I could imagine that traveling to and from Manhattan would be a good indication of the work life where most businesses would operate for those who are looking to commute via bike.

Answer: Users commute from less city like areas, to the business areas of NY. Just my assumption.

## Summary
All findings lead to the fact that working men should be targeted by this subscription service. One caveat being that you cannot compare such a smaller, different city like Des Moines to NYC. It just doesn't translate so this data could be entirely wrong.
